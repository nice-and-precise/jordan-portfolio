# Jordan Damhof | Operations & Strategy

**"Outcomes, not hours."**

This repository hosts the personal portfolio for Jordan Damhof.

## Overview

Refactored in 2025 to the "Industrial Swiss" design system. 
- **Zero Latency**: All data is hardcoded. Fetch requests are abolished.
- **Pure Efficiency**: Single-file architecture (`index.html`). No build step. No dependencies.
- **High-Ticket Focus**: Dark mode, strict grid, value-driven copy.
- **PWA Ready**: Installable on mobile devices with custom icons.

## Deployment

Hosted on Firebase Hosting.

```bash
# To deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Structure
- `index.html`: The entire application (HTML, CSS, JS, Data).
- `manifest.json`: PWA configuration.
- `assets/`: Images and icons.
- `_legacy/`: Archived code and docs from previous versions.
