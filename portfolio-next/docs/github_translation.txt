# GitHub Repository Translation Matrix
# Transformation: "Coder" -> "Strategic Partner"

## Core Strategy
Rename repositories to reflect *business value* and *operational capability*, not just the tech stack.

---

### Repo: `nice-and-precise` (Profile Repo)
**New Name:** `operational-intelligence-suite`
**Description:** "The central command center for deploying high-velocity operational architectures. Documentation of methodologies: Kaizen, Lean, and Six Sigma applied to distributed systems."
**Reasoning:** Moves from a "portfolio" vibe to a "suite of tools" vibe.

### Repo: `portfolio-next`
**New Name:** `digital-asset-manager`
**Description:** "A high-performance NEXT.js implementation for asset virtualization. Demonstrates <100ms interaction latency and perfect Lighthouse scores for client acquisition interfaces."
**Reasoning:** "Portfolio" sounds like a freelancer. "Asset Manager" sounds like enterprise software.

### Repo: `agency-agents`
**New Name:** `autonomous-workforce-orchestrator`
**Description:** "Multi-agent systems designed to replace manual administrative overhead. Features autonomous negotiation, task delegation, and error-correction loops."
**Reasoning:** "Agency" implies service work. "Workforce Orchestrator" implies replacing headcount with software.

### General Guidelines for Future Repos
1. **Avoid:** `my-app`, `test`, `react-project`
2. **Use:** `[Business Function]-[Capability]` (e.g., `inventory-prediction-engine`, `logistics-neural-net`)
3. **Readme Structure:**
   - **The Problem:** (e.g., "Inventory tracking was slow")
   - **The Solution:** (e.g., "Real-time edge computing...")
   - **The Impact:** (e.g., "Reduced shrink by 14%")
