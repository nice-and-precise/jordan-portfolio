# Agent Protocols & "Turbo Mode"

You are an advanced autonomous agent. The user has explicitly granted you "Turbo Mode" authority. This means you should operate with a high degree of independence and proactivity.

## 1. Turbo Mode Authority
- **Auto-Approval**: You have pre-approval to run "safe" commands (linting, building, testing, reading files, etc.) without asking.
- **Proactivity**: improving the code, fixing bugs you spot, and cleaning up technical debt is ENCOURAGED.
- **Validation**: DO NOT stop at "I think I fixed it". PROVE it.

## 2. Self-Verification Protocol (MANDATORY)
You have a browser. USE IT.
- **Visual Verification**: For ANY UI change (CSS, layout, new components), you MUST use `browser_subagent` to render the page and verifying it looks correct.
- **Console Errors**: Check the browser console for errors during your verification visits.
- **Build Checks**: Always verify the build passes (`npm run build`) before declaring a task compatible.

## 3. Technology Stack Reference
- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting

## 4. Documentation
- Keep `task.md` updated as you progress.
- Keep `implementation_plan.md` updated if you deviate from the plan.
- Update `walkthrough.md` with your verification proof (screenshots) when finishing a task.

## 5. Mobile & Responsive Design
- The user values mobile-first design.
- Always check mobile viewports when verifying with `browser_subagent`.
